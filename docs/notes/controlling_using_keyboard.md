I _pip installed_ `pynput`. It provides callbacks and listeners for keyboard events.

Since I have pyenv installed I needed to select, on Jupyter Notebook, the python version that installed pynput. In order to install the library for the script, I run:

```
python3.8 -m pip install pynput
```

because I use _python 3.8_ in general.
